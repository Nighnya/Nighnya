Hi there,

I'm xianii, a fullstack Electronics Engineer with expertise in schematic and layout design using KiCad.

In the firmware development process, I primarily use C to develop robust and efficient firmware for electronic products.

For web application development, I rely on Svelte to create interactive and dynamic web applications. These applications leverage webassembly technologies like Web HID and Web Bluetooth to seamlessly communicate with the firmware.

In the realm of 3D design and verification, I employ Blender to design the 3D shape of the product, and I utilize 3D printing to verify the design's functionality.

To ensure effective version control during development, I rely on Git and have also set up my own gitea server.

In the Windows environment, I use Autohotkey to write automated build and test tools, streamlining the development process.

For web application development, I leverage the power of golang and deploy applications using Docker.

Lastly, development boards such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, particularly the rp2040, are indispensable tools in my technical verification process.
